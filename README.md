# GOCDB
This repository contains all files for the [GOCDB](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/GOCDB/Documentation_Index) instance of the **ScienceMesh** project.

**Note:** All files contained in this repository are tailored towards the ScienceMesh project; they are _not_ meant as general-purpose solutions.

## Container
Since there is no official GOCDB container, one has been manually created for the project. All files can be found under [container](container/README.md).

## Charts
Helm templates for easy deployment of the GOCDB can be found in the `charts` folder.
